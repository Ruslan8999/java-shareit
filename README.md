# Shareit
### This is a service where users share things!
____
It provides users, firstly, with the opportunity to tell what things they are ready to share, and secondly, to find the right thing and rent it for a while.

The service not only allows you to book a thing for certain dates, but also closes access to it for the time of booking from other people. In case the necessary thing is not on the service, users have the opportunity to leave requests. For example, suddenly an ancient gramophone, which is strange even to offer for rent, will suddenly be needed for a theatrical production. Upon request, you can add new things for sharing.
